The process presented as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate is one that will be valuable to you as you keep moving forward in your career:

    Ask: business challenge, objective, or question

    Prepare: data generation, collection, storage, and data management

    Process: data cleaning and data integrity

    Analyze: data exploration, visualization, and analysis

    Share: communicating and interpreting results 

    Act:  putting  insights to work to solve the problem

EMC's data analysis process

EMC Corporation's data analytics process is cyclical with six steps:

    Discovery

    Pre-processing data

    Model planning

    Model building

    Communicate results

    Operationalize

EMC Corporation is now Dell EMC. This model, created by David Dietrich, reflects the cyclical nature of typical business projects. The phases aren’t static milestones; each step connects and leads to the next, and eventually repeats. Key questions help analysts test whether they have accomplished enough to move forward and ensure that teams have spent enough time on each of the phases and don’t start modeling before the data is ready. It is a little different from the data analysis process on which this program is based on, but it has some core ideas in common: the first phase is interested in discovering and asking questions; data has to be prepared before it can be analyzed and used; and then findings should be shared and acted on.

SAS's iterative process

An iterative data analysis process was created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results: 

    Ask

    Prepare

    Explore

    Model

    Implement

    Act

    Evaluate

The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol. Its process has seven steps, many of which mirror the other models, like ask, prepare, model, and act. But this process is also a little different; it includes a step after the act phase designed to help analysts evaluate their solutions and potentially return to the ask phase again.

Project-based data analytics process 

A project-based data analytics process has five simple steps:

    Identifying the problem

    Designing data requirements

    Pre-processing data

    Performing data analysis

    Visualizing data

This data analytics project process was developed by Vignesh Prajapati. It doesn’t include the sixth phase, or the act phase. However, it still covers a lot of the same steps described. It begins with identifying the problem, preparing and processing data before analysis, and ends with data visualization.

Big data analytics process

Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics process in their book, Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques. Their process suggests phases divided into nine steps:

    Business case evaluation

    Data identification

    Data acquisition and filtering

    Data extraction

    Data validation and cleaning 

    Data aggregation and representation

    Data analysis

    Data visualization

    Utilization of analysis results

This process appears to have three or four more steps than the previous models. But in reality, they have just broken down what has been referred to as prepare and process into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase.
