Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another
in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.
These elements include hardware and software tools, and
the people who use them.
People like you.
Data can also be found in something called the cloud.
The cloud is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive.
So instead of storing data somewhere inside your organization's network,
that data is accessed over the internet.
So the cloud is just a term we use to describe the virtual location.
The cloud plays a big part in the data ecosystem, and as a data analyst, it's
your job to harness the power of that data ecosystem, find the right information,
and provide the team with analysis that helps them make smart decisions.
For example, you could tap into your retail store's database,
which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses,
previous purchases, and customer reviews.
As a data analyst, you could use this information to predict what these
customers will buy in the future,
and make sure the store has the products and stock when they're needed.
As another example,
let's think about a data ecosystem used by a human resources department.
This ecosystem would include information like postings from job websites,
stats on the current labor market,
employment rates, and social media data on prospective employees.
A data analyst could use this information to help their team recruit new workers
and improve employee engagement and retention rates.
But data ecosystems aren't just for stores and offices.

First is the difference between data scientists and data analysts.
It's easy to confuse the two, but what they do is actually very different.
Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and
understanding the unknown by using raw data.
Here's a good way to think about it.
Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find
answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.
There are also many words and
phrases you'll hear throughout this course, that are easy to get mixed up.
For example, data analysis and data analytics sound the same,
but they're actually very different things. Let's start with analysis.
You've already learned that data analysis is the collection, transformation,
and organization of data in order to draw conclusions,
make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data.
