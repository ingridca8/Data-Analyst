Now, data science, the discipline of making data useful,
is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines:
machine learning, statistics, and analytics.
These are separated by
how many decisions you know
you want to make before you begin with them.
If you want to make a few important decisions under
uncertainty, that is statistics.
If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many,
many decisions under uncertainty,
that is machine learning and AI.
But what if you don't know
how many decisions you want to make before you begin?
What if what you're looking for is inspiration?
You want to encounter your unknown unknowns.
You want to understand your world.
That is analytics. 

Which of the three excellences
in data science feels like a better fit for you?
The excellence of statistics is rigor.
Statisticians are essentially philosophers,
epistemologists.
They are very, very careful about
protecting decision-makers from coming
to the wrong conclusion.
If that care and rigor is what you are passionate about,
I would recommend statistics.
Performance is the excellence of
the machine learning and AI engineer.
You know that's the one for you if someone says to you,
"I bet that you couldn't build
an automation system that performs this task with
99.99999 percent accuracy," and
your response to that is, "Watch me."
How about analytics?
The excellence of an analyst is speed.
How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of
data to explore it and discover the gems,
the beautiful potential insights that are
worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers?
Are you excited by the ambiguity of exploration?
Are you excited by the idea
of working on a lot of different things,
looking at a lot of different data sources,
and thinking through vast amounts of information,
while promising not to
snooze past the important potential insights?
Are you okay being told,
"Here is a whole lot of data.
No one has looked at it before.
Go find something interesting"?
Do you thrive on creative, open-ended projects?
If that's you, then
analytics is probably the best fit for you.
