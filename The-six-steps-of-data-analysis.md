The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. These six steps apply to any data analysis.
The data analysis process is composed of the six phases of ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Their purpose is to gain insights that drive informed decision-making.

## Process
* They restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts. 
* They cleaned the data to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data was aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses. 
* They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security.

## Analyse
Here we have to do a documentation of the results no matter what those are.

The data analysis process helps analysts break down business problems into a series of manageable tasks: 

In the ask phase, you’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be  answered. It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders. As this is the ask phase, you’ll ask many questions to help you along the way. 

Next, in the prepare phase, you’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions. You’ll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions. 

The process phase is when you will clean and organize your data. Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies; filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with. Essentially, you’re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.

The analyze phase is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions. Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.

Next comes the share phase, when you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations. As part of the share phase, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include. Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R. 

Last is the act phase, in which you and others in the company put the data insights into action. This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem. 

Iteration during the data analysis process

The data analysis process is designed to build on itself, so the results from each step are the inputs for the next step. Keep in mind, however, that you might not always move through the steps linearly. For example, you might be in the analyze phase and find out your data was pulled from the wrong database. Or, you could learn while cleaning the data that your original question didn’t adequately define the problem. 

In cases such as these, you may have to go back to an earlier stage and work through the process with new, better information. The important thing is not to skip steps and miss something that’s important. In fact, the biggest mistake analysts make when using this framework is looking for quick and easy answers. 

Finally, make sure to review your work in each phase of the analysis. This helps you learn more about the situation and your own skill set, which will lead to the kind of continuous growth that helps data professionals succeed.
